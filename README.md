1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a thorough analysis of its software systems to identify security vulnerabilities. The client aimed to enhance the overall security posture of their applications, ensuring they could withstand potential cyber threats and comply with industry standards.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
In conducting the vulnerability assessment, I excelled in systematically identifying and documenting security flaws within the codebase. I employed tools like [specific tools you used, e.g., OWASP ZAP, static analysis tools], which facilitated a comprehensive evaluation of the software's security. Coding securely is crucial as it protects sensitive client data, reduces the risk of financial loss, and maintains the organization's reputation. Effective software security can significantly enhance client trust and customer satisfaction, ultimately contributing to the company's long-term success.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One of the most challenging aspects of the vulnerability assessment was [describe a specific challenge, e.g., navigating complex code or interpreting scan results]. However, this challenge proved helpful as it deepened my understanding of security vulnerabilities and strengthened my problem-solving skills.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, I implemented [specific security measures, e.g., encryption, input validation, secure coding practices]. In the future, I would utilize a combination of automated scanning tools and manual code reviews to assess vulnerabilities, deciding on mitigation techniques based on the severity of the identified risks.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure that the code and application remained functional and secure, I conducted thorough testing, including unit tests and integration tests, after refactoring the code. I checked for new vulnerabilities using [specific testing tools or methods you applied, e.g., penetration testing]. This helped confirm that my changes did not introduce additional security flaws.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I utilized various resources and tools, such as [mention any libraries, frameworks, or coding standards you followed], which not only improved the security of this project but will also be beneficial in future assignments. Best practices, like code reviews and following secure coding guidelines, were particularly valuable.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
For future employers, I would highlight my role in the vulnerability assessment process and the secure coding practices I implemented. This experience demonstrates my ability to identify and mitigate security risks effectively, showcasing my commitment to producing high-quality, secure software solutions.
